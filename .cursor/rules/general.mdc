# Design principles

Key design principles are elegance, simplicity, focus and readability.

Critique designs and ask if they _feel_ elegant and clean

# Logging

- ERR: Unrecoverable failures, ideally as a bubbled exception
- WARN: Recoverable failure, continues
- INFO: Shows logical program flow, what it is doing at particular stages
- DEBUG: insight into _state_ at key points, more verbose

Use debug logs wen tracing down defects to inspect state, use verbose logging to show debug logs

# Testing

- Use unit tests to verify indivdiual module contracts, not internals
- Use simple e2e tests using ./scripts/e2e.sh <test_name> (or empty for all)
