# Git Commit Conventions

All commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Commit Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no behavior change)
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (config, build, dependencies)
- `perf`: Performance improvements

## Scope

Use the area of codebase affected:
- `core`: Core singletons (TimeManager, EventBus, DataManager, GameLoop)
- `models`: Data models (ShipClass, Fleet, Colony, etc.)
- `systems`: Simulation systems (EconomySystem, FleetSystem, etc.)
- `ui`: User interface scripts and scenes
- `gamestate`: GameState singleton
- `scene`: Scene files (.tscn)
- `config`: Configuration files

## Subject

- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- First line should be ≤72 characters
- Don't capitalize first letter
- No period at the end

## Body

- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain **what** and **why** (not **how**)
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Reference issues/PRs if applicable

## Examples

```
feat(core): add TimeManager singleton for time control

- Centralize all time scale management
- Support pause and multiple speed settings (1x, 2x, 4x, 8x)
- Listen to EventBus for time scale requests

Closes #123
```

```
refactor(gamestate): remove redundant time management

Remove _isPaused and _timeScale fields that duplicate TimeManager
functionality. All time state queries now delegate to TimeManager.

This improves separation of concerns and reduces state duplication.
```

## Commit Grouping

Group related changes into logical commits:
- One feature per commit when possible
- Group refactors together if they're part of the same change
- Separate bug fixes from features
- Keep configuration changes separate from code changes
